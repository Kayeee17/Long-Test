        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computing resources, such as storage, servers, databases,
            networking, and software, over the internet1234.
            Cloud computing allows users to access these resources without direct active management or
            self-maintenance12. Users can pay for what they use and access the resources from any device with an
            internet connection24.
            Cloud computing is provided by remote data centers managed by cloud service providers3</p>

        <h2>Disdvantages</h2>
        <img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2022/06/21/16/cso_nw_cloud_computing_cloud_network_circuits_by_denis_isakov_gettyimages-966932508_2400x1600-100814451-large-100929305-large.jpg?auto=webp&quality=85,70" alt="" id="image-right">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Security and Privacy Concerns</b></li>
            <p>Storing sensitive data and applications on third-party servers raises concerns about data security and privacy.
                While cloud providers implement robust security measures, such as encryption and access controls, there's always a risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.
                Additionally, regulatory compliance requirements may restrict the types of data that can be stored in the cloud, adding complexity to compliance efforts.</p>

            <li><b>Dependency on Internet Connectivity</b></li>
            <p>Cloud computing relies heavily on internet connectivity. If the internet connection is slow or unreliable, it can impact access to cloud services and disrupt business operations. Moreover, in areas with limited internet infrastructure or during outages, users may experience downtime, preventing them from accessing critical resources stored in the cloud.</p>

            <li><b>Limited Control and Customization</b></li>
            <p>When organizations migrate their infrastructure and applications to the cloud, they relinquish some control over the underlying hardware and software.
                Cloud service providers manage the infrastructure, updates, and maintenance, which means organizations may have limited customization options or be subject to the provider's policies and procedures.
                This lack of control can be challenging for businesses with specific regulatory requirements or unique IT needs.</p>

            <li><b>Potential for Vendor Lock-In</b></li>
            <p>Switching cloud providers or migrating data and applications between different cloud platforms can be complex and costly.
                Organizations that heavily invest in a particular cloud provider's ecosystem may find themselves locked into their services, making it difficult to transition to alternative providers or bring services back in-house.
                Vendor lock-in can limit flexibility and negotiating power, potentially leading to higher costs over time.</p>

            <li><b>Performance and Reliability Concerns</b></li>
            <p>While cloud providers strive to offer high-performance and reliable services,occasional outages and performance issues can still occur. Businesses may experience latency, slowdowns, or service disruptions
                due to factors such as server maintenance,hardware failures, or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
                Depending solely on cloud services for critical operations without backup plans or redundancy measures can pose risks to business continuity.</p>
